	 * When creating DT for the guest domain Xen inserts only dummy CPU nodes.
	 * And the number of these inserted CPU nodes is equal to the number of
	 * vCPUs assigned to this domain. All CPU properties which original DT has,
	 * such as OPP, clock, regulator, etc are not passed to the guestâ€™s DT.
	 *
	 * Example of guest vCPU node:
	 *
	 * cpu@0 {
	 *     device_type = "cpu";
	 *     compatible = "arm,armv8";
	 *     enable-method = "psci";

	 * This results in the fact that all features expecting a57_x CPU node
	 * to be present get broken. This is why we have to explicitly
	 * remove the following.
